		<h2>Frame the problem</h2>
		<h5>1. Neighborhood Context: How did I come up with this problem?</h5>
		<p>Nowadays in China, many of the babies are raised by their grandparents because their parents are both busy at work. As we all know, raising a baby can be really complicated: when to have the next vaccine, when to feed them and change their diapers. My grandparents feel it is sometimes difficult to remember all of things they need to do to care for my little sister. Moreover, parents of the baby also want to watch her growth by looking at this recorded data.</p>
		<h5>2. Interviews & Persona: What are the users' real needs</h5>
		<p>In order to know more about the real needs of this kind of typical Chinese family, I conducted 4 interviews with potential users who had troubles raising up their new-born baby. Below are quotes expressed their main concerns and needs:</br>
		<strong>Key findings of interviews</strong></br>
		<strong>Grandparents:</strong> Need a clear, simple tool which can help them remember all the trivial things of the baby, providing instructions.</br>
		<strong>Parents: </strong>Want to feel engaged in the raising process even they can not directly take care of their baby.</br>
		Having known more about users' behaviour and cognition, I synthesized the information I gathered into four personas. Through this process, I gained a even more clear vision of the target users and their needs.</p>
		<p>Story map is generated from the personas I have made before. I chose my primary persona and walk through the tasks she would do taking care of newborn baby.  Here I analyzed users' tasks step by step  to ensure a common understanding of  tasks one step at a time. After this, I got to know more detailed parts about users' pain points when they finished a task.</p>

		<h2>Design Alternatives</h2>
		<h5>1. Brainstorming: What features we want, despite of technical issues. </h5>
		<p>In precious steps, I used interview, persona and story map and get a deep understanding of users' real needs. What are there pain points when they took care of the newborn baby and what kind of functions they need. So here in the next step, I begin to brainstorm some possible features I would like to include in my product, in order to solve their problem.</p>
