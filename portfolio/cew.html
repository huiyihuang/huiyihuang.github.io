		<h2>Background</h2>
		<h4>1. About our client: What are they focusing on?</h4>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-lg-7 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><p>The CEW (Center for the Education of Women), a historical organization established in 1964, aims to give women and non-traditional students chances to study at the University of Michigan and help them achieve success (CEW). CEW provides them with help and resources, including workshops, scholarships and fellowships. However, the scholarship program is taking up much more time than anticipated, leaving less time available for other CEW programs.</p></div>
  			<div class="col-lg-5 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 p3"><img src="img/work2/1.png" alt="cew logo"></div>
		</div>
		<h4>2. Current scholarship process: What they did and proposed problems.</h4>
		<img class = "middle-image" src="img/work2/2.png" alt="work process">
		<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">As been proposed by CEW staffs, the main problem and the most time-consuming part happened in the matching stage:</span></p>
		<ul>
		<li>Firstly, CEW has to meet the intentions of all the donors.The bigger the number of donors, the harder the matching process. Different donors have different intentions: some of them would like to support a student in a specific major, some of them would like to give their help to a mother with children.</li>
		<li>Secondly, CEW has nearly hundreds of applications in one year.
		Nearly every one of them has a typical situation, CEW has to integrate all of their personal statements and find out who is more suitable for a specific scholarship.</li>
		<li>Thirdly, CEW is also experiencing difficulties determining the award amounts.
		They have to figure out how much they can give to each student by corresponding with the Financial Aid Office. The responses regarding the financial aid package of each student are often delayed and uncertain until the last minute, causing the CEW to take almost half a year to inform the students of their scholarship amounts.</li></ul>
